 * A subpath specifier never reads package.json; its icon comes only from `<specifier>/icon`.
 * Manifest icons remain inside their declaring directory; exported icons remain inside their
 * owning package after realpath resolution. Both accept SVG, PNG, JPEG, or WebP up to 256 KiB.
 * Icon failures retain display text without falling back.
 * Non-package specifiers are skipped without invoking the resource resolver.
 * Language files share the directory containing the resolved English resource;
 * each file is resolved through the complete plugin specifier before reading.
 * Translation maps retain an English fallback, ultimately the full module specifier
 * for titles and empty for descriptions.
 * @param specifier - configured plugin module name, including any package subpath.
 * @param parentURL - owning Loader tree's module-resolution base.
 * @returns display fields and any resource diagnostic, or undefined for non-package specifiers or absent metadata.
